/**
 *! below is a middleware function
 ** Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req),
 ** the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.
 ** The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked,
 ** executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.
 ** Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
 **    - Execute any code.
 **    - Make changes to the request and the response objects.
 **    - End the request-response cycle.
 **    - Call the next middleware in the stack.
 ** If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle,
 ** it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function.
 ** Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.
